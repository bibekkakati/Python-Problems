# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this
# opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in
# the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the
# sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
# 13, â€¦)

numbersToGenerate = int(input('How many numbers to generate : '))

a = 0
b = 1

list = [a, b]

for i in range(2, numbersToGenerate):
    c = a + b
    list.append(c)
    a = b
    b = c


print(list)
